Based on this article, you will answer the following questions regarding the effect of what is going to happen in China on the U.S. economy in 2023. Remember, we are interested in what happens in the U.S. Assume the U.S. economy is in long-run equilibrium before China changes its policy. Using AD-AS model, mark the initial equilibrium as point 'A' in the below figure. Label all the axes, curves and initial value of the variables internal to the model. Then show the final position of the U.S. economy after this policy shift in China by drawing new appropriate curve(s) and labeling the new equilibrium point as 'B'. ",
